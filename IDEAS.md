## Ideas for Future Versions

Version 2 (Required):

- needs to accept chain (string) for any publication
- needs to store the hashes per chain
- our manifest needs to change to reference two additional peices of data. The timestamp file and the names database (in csv format).

Would be nice

- A value called 'upgradedTo' that accepts an address and stays empty until the owner sets it. If non-empty, all functions are disabled (through a require) and the value points to the upgraded contract
- Marketing material surrounding the idea that this hash is the cheapest possible way to publish access to the entire chain's index
- Allow others to submit names files for possible inclusion in the names database
